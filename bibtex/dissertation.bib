abstract = {The use of information from flanking markers to estimate the position and size of the effect of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) lying between two markers is shown to be affected by QTLs lying in neighbouring regions of the chromosome. In some situations the effects of two QTLs lying outside the flanked region are reinforced in such a way that a 'ghost' QTL may be mistakenly identified as a real QTL. These problems are discussed in the framework of a backcross using a regression model as the analytical tool to present the theoretical results. Regression models that use information obtained from three or more nearby markers are shown to be useful in separating the effects of QTLs in neighbouring regions. A simulated data set exemplifies the problem and is analysed by the interval mapping method as well as by the regression model.},

@article{Dudbridge2004,
abstract = {Large exploratory studies, including candidate-gene-association testing, genomewide linkage-disequilibrium scans, and array-expression experiments, are becoming increasingly common. A serious problem for such studies is that statistical power is compromised by the need to control the false-positive rate for a large family of tests. Because multiple true associations are anticipated, methods have been proposed that combine evidence from the most significant tests, as a more powerful alternative to individually adjusted tests. The practical application of these methods is currently limited by a reliance on permutation testing to account for the correlated nature of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-association data. On a genomewide scale, this is both very time-consuming and impractical for repeated explorations with standard marker panels. Here, we alleviate these problems by fitting analytic distributions to the empirical distribution of combined evidence. We fit extreme-value distributions for fixed lengths of combined evidence and a beta distribution for the most significant length. An initial phase of permutation sampling is required to fit these distributions, but it can be completed more quickly than a simple permutation test and need be done only once for each panel of tests, after which the fitted parameters give a reusable calibration of the panel. Our approach is also a more efficient alternative to a standard permutation test. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach and compare its efficiency with that of permutation tests on genomewide SNP data released by the International HapMap Consortium. The estimation of analytic distributions for combined evidence will allow these powerful methods to be applied more widely in large exploratory studies.},

@article{Smith2003,
abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {Here we provide a genome-wide, high-resolution map of the phylogenetic origin of the genome of most extant laboratory mouse inbred strains. Our analysis is based on the genotypes of wild-caught mice from three subspecies of Mus musculus. We show that classical laboratory strains are derived from a few fancy mice with limited haplotype diversity. Their genomes are overwhelmingly Mus musculus domesticus in origin, and the remainder is mostly of Japanese origin. We generated genome-wide haplotype maps based on identity by descent from fancy mice and show that classical inbred strains have limited and non-randomly distributed genetic diversity. In contrast, wild-derived laboratory strains represent a broad sampling of diversity within M. musculus. Intersubspecific introgression is pervasive in these strains, and contamination by laboratory stocks has played a role in this process. The subspecific origin, haplotype diversity and identity by descent maps can be visualized using the Mouse Phylogeny Viewer (see URLs).},

The principal exception is maize (corn), an annual seed-produced outbreeder in nature. It is noteworthy that maize joined wheat, rice, and barley as a truly major crop worldwide only after its conversion to self-pollination combined with hybridization between favorably interacting inbred lines increased yield of maize several-fold in the twentieth century.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

abstract = {This study investigated the magnitude of inbreeding depression in fecundity, and whether the depression is purged during six generations of sib mating in the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. The progeny resulting from a single generation of brother-sister mating suffered significant inbreeding depression in fecundity. During the following six generations of continuous sib-mating, 58{\%} lines were lost, 45{\%} because of sterility and 13{\%} because of preadult mortality. The lines were then outcrossed, and their inbreeding depression compared with that of the base population. The inbreeding depression for the outcrossed population was 0.15, and for the base population 0.19, but the difference was not significant. The lack of significant purging of inbreeding depression indicates that it was caused either by detrimental genes of small effect, or by the breaking down of overdominant relations between alleles. However, the large proportion of extinct lines points to the former mechanism as a predominant cause of inbreeding depression. Theory predicts that the probability of line extinction with inbreeding increases with its load of mutations. If phenotypic variation in fecundity was partly because of differences in numbers of mutations carried by individuals, the fecundity of the line founder could be expected to correlate with the probability that the line derived from it will survive long-term inbreeding. Indeed, fecundity of founder females was significantly associated with line survival, which suggests that line extinction rate may be used as a method to study individual mutational loads, for example, in studies of sexual selection.},

abstract = {The Collaborative Cross Consortium reports here on the development of a unique genetic resource population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparental recombinant inbred panel derived from eight laboratory mouse inbred strains. Breeding of the CC lines was initiated at multiple international sites using mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Currently, this innovative project is breeding independent CC lines at the University of North Carolina (UNC), at Tel Aviv University (TAU), and at Geniad in Western Australia (GND). These institutions aim to make publicly available the completed CC lines and their genotypes and sequence information. We genotyped, and report here, results from 458 extant lines from UNC, TAU, and GND using a custom genotyping array with 7500 SNPs designed to be maximally informative in the CC and used a novel algorithm to infer inherited haplotypes directly from hybridization intensity patterns. We identified lines with breeding errors and cousin lines generated by splitting incipient lines into two or more cousin lines at early generations of inbreeding. We then characterized the genome architecture of 350 genetically independent CC lines. Results showed that founder haplotypes are inherited at the expected frequency, although we also consistently observed highly significant transmission ratio distortion at specific loci across all three populations. On chromosome 2, there is significant overrepresentation of WSB/EiJ alleles, and on chromosome X, there is a large deficit of CC lines with CAST/EiJ alleles. Linkage disequilibrium decays as expected and we saw no evidence of gametic disequilibrium in the CC population as a whole or in random subsets of the population. Gametic equilibrium in the CC population is in marked contrast to the gametic disequilibrium present in a large panel of classical inbred strains. Finally, we discuss access to the CC population and to the associated raw data describing the genetic structure of individual lines. Integration of rich phenotypic and genomic data over time and across a wide variety of fields will be vital to delivering on one of the key attributes of the CC, a common genetic reference platform for identifying causative variants and genetic networks determining traits in mammals.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic architecture of traits in breeding programs can be critical for making genetic progress. Important factors include the number of loci controlling a trait, allele frequencies at those loci, and allele effects in breeding germplasm. To this end, multiparental populations offer many advantages for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses compared to biparental populations. These include increased power for QTL detection, the ability to sample a larger number of segregating loci and alleles, and estimation of allele effects across diverse genetic backgrounds. Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to crown rot disease caused by Phytophthora cactorum in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), using connected full-sib families from a breeding population. Clonal replicates of {\textgreater} 1100 seedlings from 139 full-sib families arising from 61 parents were control-inoculated during two consecutive seasons. Subgenome-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were mapped in allo-octoploid strawberry (2n = 8 × = 56), and FlexQTL software was utilized to perform a Bayesian, pedigree-based QTL analysis. A major locus on linkage group (LG) 7D, which we name FaRPc2, accounts for most of the genetic variation for resistance. Four predominant SNP haplotypes were detected in the FaRPc2 region, two of which are strongly associated with two different levels of resistance, suggesting the presence of multiple resistance alleles. The phenotypic effects of FaRPc2 alleles across trials and across numerous genetic backgrounds make this locus a highly desirable target for genetic improvement of resistance in cultivated strawberry.},

abstract = {The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a panel of recently established multiparental recombinant inbred mouse strains. For the CC, as for any multiparental population (MPP), effective experimental design and analysis benefit from detailed knowledge of the genetic differences between strains. Such differences can be directly determined by sequencing, but until now whole-genome sequencing was not publicly available for individual CC strains. An alternative and complementary approach is to infer genetic differences by combining two pieces of information: probabilistic estimates of the CC haplotype mosaic from a custom genotyping array, and probabilistic variant calls from sequencing of the CC founders. The computation for this inference, especially when performed genome-wide, can be intricate and time-consuming, requiring the researcher to generate nontrivial and potentially error-prone scripts. To provide standardized, easy-to-access CC sequence information, we have developed the Inbred Strain Variant Database (ISVdb). The ISVdb provides, for all the exonic variants from the Sanger Institute mouse sequencing dataset, direct sequence information for CC founders and, critically, the imputed sequence information for CC strains. Notably, the ISVdb also: (1) provides predicted variant consequence metadata; (2) allows rapid simulation of F1 populations; and (3) preserves imputation uncertainty, which will allow imputed data to be refined in the future as additional sequencing and genotyping data are collected. The ISVdb information is housed in an SQL database and is easily accessible through a custom online interface (http://isvdb.unc.edu), reducing the analytic burden on any researcher using the CC.},

Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.},

Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies.

abstract = {An advanced intercrossed line (AIL) is an experimental population that can provide more accurate estimates of quantitative trait loci (QTL) map location than conventional mapping populations. An AIL is produced by randomly and sequentially intercrossing a population that initially originated from a cross between two inbred lines or some variant thereof. This provides increasing probability of recombination between any two loci. Consequently, the genetic length of the entire genome is stretched, providing increased mapping resolution. In this way, for example, with the same population size and QTL effect, a 95{\%} confidence interval of QTL map location of 20 cM in the F2 is reduced fivefold after eight additional random mating generations (F10). Simulation results showed that to obtain the anticipated reduction in the confidence interval, breeding population size of the AIL in all generations should comprise an effective number of {\textgreater} or = 100 individuals. It is proposed that AILs derived from crosses between known inbred lines may be a useful resource for fine genetic mapping.},

abstract = {Numerous methods exist for inferring the ancestry mosaic of an admixed individual based on its genotypes and those of its ancestors. These methods rely on bialleic SNPs obtained from genotype calling algorithms, which classify each marker as belonging to one of four states (reference allele, alternate allele, heterozygous, or no call) based on probe hybridization intensity signals. We demonstrate that this conversion of probe intensities to discrete genotypes can lead to a loss of information and introduce errors via incorrect genotype calls. We propose a method that directly infers ancestry from probe intensities by minimizing the intensity difference between a target individual and one or more of its ancestors. We demonstrate our method on mice from the developing Collaborative Cross (CC) genetic reference population, which are admixtures of a common set of eight ancestors. Our samples were genotyped using a 7.8K-marker Illumina Infinium platform called the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA). We compare our reconstructions with a standard genotype-based method and validate our results using DNA sequencing data. Our algorithm is able to use information not captured by genotype calls and avoid errors due to incorrect calls. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits remains a major challenge in biology. Polygenicity, phenotypic plasticity and epistasis contribute to phenotypic variance in ways that are rarely clear. This uncertainty is problematic for estimating heritability, for predicting individual phenotypes from genomic data, and for parameterizing models of phenotypic evolution. Here we report a recombinant inbred line (RIL) quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping panel for the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the C. elegans multiparental experimental evolution (CeMEE) panel. The CeMEE panel, comprising 507 RILs, was created by hybridization of 16 wild isolates, experimental evolution at moderate population sizes and predominant outcrossing for 140-190 generations, and inbreeding by selfing for 13-16 generations. The panel contains 22{\%} of single nucleotide polymorphisms known to segregate in natural populations, and complements existing mapping resources for C. elegans by providing high nucleotide diversity across {\&}gt;95{\%} of the genome. We apply it to study the genetic basis of two fitness components, fertility and hermaphrodite body size at time of reproduction, with high broad sense heritability in the CeMEE. While simulations show we should detect common alleles with additive effects as small as 5{\%}, at gene-level resolution, the genetic architectures of these traits does not feature such alleles. We instead find that a significant fraction of trait variance, particularly for fertility, can be explained by sign epistasis with weak main effects. In congruence, phenotype prediction, while generally poor (r2{\&}lt;10{\%}), requires modeling epistasis for optimal accuracy, with most variance attributed to the highly recombinant, rapidly evolving chromosome arms.},

abstract = {A major goal in the analysis of complex traits is to partition the observed genetic variation in a trait into components due to individual loci and perhaps variants within those loci. However, in both QTL mapping and genetic association studies, the estimated percent variation attributable to a QTL is upwardly biased conditional on it being discovered. This bias was first described in two-way QTL mapping experiments by William Beavis, and has been referred to extensively as “the Beavis effect.” The Beavis effect is likely to occur in multiparent population (MPP) panels as well as collections of sequenced lines used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the strength of the Beavis effect is unknown—and often implicitly assumed to be negligible—when “hits” are obtained from an association panel consisting of hundreds of inbred lines tested across millions of SNPs, or in multiparent mapping populations where mapping involves fitting a complex statistical model with several d.f. at thousands of genetic intervals. To estimate the size of the effect in more complex panels, we performed simulations of both biallelic and multiallelic QTL in two major Drosophila melanogaster mapping panels, the GWAS-based Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), and the MPP the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR). Our results show that overestimation is determined most strongly by sample size and is only minimally impacted by the mapping design. When {\&}lt; 100, 200, 500, and 1000 lines are employed, the variance attributable to hits is inflated by factors of 6, 3, 1.5, and 1.1, respectively, for a QTL that truly contributes 5{\%} to the variation in the trait. This overestimation indicates that QTL could be difficult to validate in follow-up replication experiments where additional individuals are examined. Further, QTL could be difficult to cross-validate between the two Drosophila resources. We provide guidelines for: (1) the sample sizes necessary to accurately estimate the percent variance to an identified QTL, (2) the conditions under which one is likely to replicate a mapped QTL in a second study using the same mapping population, and (3) the conditions under which a QTL mapped in one mapping panel is likely to replicate in the other (DGRP and DSPR).},

abstract = {Inbred mice were essential animal models for scientific research during the 20th century and will contribute decisive results in the current and next centuries. Far from becoming an obsolete research tool, the generation of new inbred strains is continuing and such strains are being used in many research fields. However, their genetic properties have been overlooked for decades, although recent research has revealed new insights into their genetic fragility and relative instability. Contrary to what we usually assume, inbred mice are far from being completely isogenic and both single-gene major mutations and polygenic mutational variability are continuously uploading into inbred populations as new sources of genetic polymorphisms. Note that several inbred strains from new major mutations are released every year, whereas small mutations can accumulate up to accounting for a significant percentage of the phenotypic variance (e.g. 4.5{\%} in a recent study on C57BL/6J mice). Moreover, this genetic heterogeneity can be maintained for several generations by heterozygote selection and, if fixed instead of dropping off, genetic drift must be anticipated. The contribution of accidental genetic contamination in inbred strains must also be considered, although its incidence in current breeding stocks should be minimal, or even negligible. This review revisits several relevant topics for current inbred strains, discussing the latest cutting-edge results within the context of the genetic homogeneity and stability of laboratory mice. Inbred mice can no longer be considered as completely isogenic, but provide a remarkably homogeneous animal model with an inevitable moderate-to-low degree of genetic variability. Despite a certain degree of genetic heterogeneity becoming inescapable, inbred mice still provide very useful animal models with evident advantages when compared with outbred, that is, highly variable, populations.},

abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated condition driven by improper responses to intestinal microflora in the context of environmental and genetic background. GWAS in humans have identified many loci associated with IBD, but animal models are valuable for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms, characterizing environmental and genetic contributions and developing treatments. Mouse models rely on interventions such as chemical treatment or introduction of an infectious agent to induce disease. Here, we describe a new model for IBD in which the disease develops spontaneously in 20-week-old mice in the absence of known murine pathogens. The model is part of the Collaborative Cross and came to our attention due to a high incidence of rectal prolapse in an incompletely inbred line. Necropsies revealed a profound proliferative colitis with variable degrees of ulceration and vasculitis, splenomegaly and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with no discernible anomalies of other organ systems. Phenotypic characterization of the CC011/Unc mice with homozygosity ranging from 94.1 to 99.8{\%} suggested that the trait was fixed and acted recessively in crosses to the colitis-resistant C57BL/6J inbred strain. Using a QTL approach, we identified four loci, Ccc1, Ccc2, Ccc3 and Ccc4 on chromosomes 12, 14, 1 and 8 that collectively explain 27.7{\%} of the phenotypic variation. Surprisingly, we also found that minute levels of residual heterozygosity in CC011/Unc have significant impact on the phenotype. This work demonstrates the utility of the CC as a source of models of human disease that arises through new combinations of alleles at susceptibility loci.},

Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points.},

abstract = {QTL (quantitative trait loci) mapping is commonly used to identify genetic regions responsible to important phenotype variation. A common strategy of QTL mapping is to use recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which are usually established by several generations of inbreeding of an F1 population (usually up to F6 or F7 populations). As this inbreeding process involves a large amount of labor, we are particularly interested in the effect of the number of inbreeding generations on the power of QTL mapping; a part of the labor could be saved if a smaller number of inbreeding provides sufficient power. By using simulations, we investigated the performance of QTL mapping with recombinant inbred lines (RILs). As expected, we found that the power of F4 population could be almost comparable to that of F6 and F7 populations. A potential problem in using F4 population is that a large proportion of RILs are heterozygotes. We here introduced a new method to partly relax this problem. The performance of this method was verified by simulations with a wide range of parameters including the size of the segregation population, recombination rate, genome size and the density of markers. We found our method works better than the commonly used standard method especially when there are a number of heterozygous markers. Our results imply that in most cases, QTL mapping does not necessarily require RILs at F6 or F7 generations; rather, F4 (or even F3) populations would be almost as useful as F6 or F7 populations. Because the cost to establish a number of RILs for many generations is enormous, this finding will cause a reduction in the cost of QTL mapping, thereby accelerating gene mapping in many species.},

To address this, we mapped genetic variants that are associated with eQTLs, ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). We found that most QTLs are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, which suggests that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we identified a class of cis QTLs that affect protein abundance with little or no effect on messenger RNA or ribosome levels, which suggests that they may arise from differences in posttranslational regulation.},

Within the High Runner (HR) lines of mice, the numerous pleiotropic effects (e.g., larger hearts, reduced total body mass and fat mass, longer hind-limb bones) of this hypothesized adaptive allele include functional characteristics that facilitate high levels of voluntary wheel running (e.g., doubling of mass-specific muscle aerobic capacity, increased fatigue resistance of isolated muscles, longer hind-limb bones). Previously, we created a backcross population suitable for mapping the responsible locus. We phenotypically characterized the population and mapped the Minimsc locus to a 2.6-Mb interval on MMU11, a region containing ∼100 known or predicted genes. Here, we present a novel strategy to identify the genetic variant causing the mini-muscle phenotype. Using high-density genotyping and whole-genome sequencing of key backcross individuals and HR mice with and without the mini-muscle mutation, from both recent and historical generations of the HR lines, we show that a SNP representing a C-to-T transition located in a 709-bp intron between exons 11 and 12 of the Myosin heavy polypeptide 4 (Myh4) skeletal muscle gene (position 67,244,850 on MMU11; assembly, December 2011, GRCm38/mm10; ENSMUSG00000057003) is responsible for the mini-muscle phenotype, Myh4(Minimsc). Using next-generation sequencing, our approach can be extended to identify causative mutations arising in mouse inbred lines and thus offers a great avenue to overcome one of the most challenging steps in quantitative genetics.},

abstract = {Mucus hyper-secretion is a hallmark feature of asthma and other muco-obstructive airway diseases. The mucin proteins MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major glycoprotein components of mucus and have critical roles in airway defense. Despite the biomedical importance of these two proteins, the loci that regulate them in the context of natural genetic variation have not been studied. To identify genes that underlie variation in airway mucin levels, we performed genetic analyses in founder strains and incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) in a house dust mite mouse model of asthma. CC founder strains exhibited significant differences in MUC5AC and MUC5B, providing evidence of heritability. Analysis of gene and protein expression of Muc5ac and Muc5b in incipient CC lines (n = 154) suggested that post-transcriptional events were important regulators of mucin protein content in the airways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified distinct, trans protein QTL for MUC5AC (chromosome 13) and MUC5B (chromosome 2). These two QTL explained 18 and 20{\%} of phenotypic variance, respectively. Examination of the MUC5B QTL allele effects and subsequent phylogenetic analysis allowed us to narrow the MUC5B QTL and identify Bpifb1 as a candidate gene. Bpifb1 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in parallel to MUC5B after allergen challenge, and Bpifb1 knockout mice exhibited higher MUC5B expression. Thus, BPIFB1 is a novel regulator of MUC5B.},

abstract = {Clinical trials of tolvaptan showed it to be a promising candidate for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) but also revealed potential for idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in this patient population. To identify risk factors and mechanisms underlying tolvaptan DILI, 8 mice in each of 45 strains of the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population were treated with a single oral dose of either tolvaptan or vehicle. Significant elevations in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed in tolvaptan-treated animals in 3 of the 45 strains. Genetic mapping coupled with transcriptomic analysis in the liver was used to identify several candidate susceptibility genes including epoxide hydrolase 2, interferon regulatory factor 3, and mitochondrial fission factor. Gene pathway analysis revealed that oxidative stress and immune response pathways were activated in response to tolvaptan treatment across all strains, but genes involved in regulation of bile acid homeostasis were most associated with tolvaptan-induced elevations in ALT. Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (Slpi) mRNA was also induced in the susceptible strains and was associated with increased plasma levels of Slpi protein, suggesting a potential serum marker for DILI susceptibility. In summary, tolvaptan induced signs of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and innate immune response in all strains, but variation in bile acid homeostasis was most associated with susceptibility to the liver response. This CC study has indicated potential mechanisms underlying tolvaptan DILI and biomarkers of susceptibility that may be useful in managing the risk of DILI in ADPKD patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are an important resource for mapping complex traits in many species. While large RI panels are available for Arabidopsis, maize, C. elegans, and Drosophila, mouse RI panels typically consist of fewer than 30 lines. This is a severe constraint on the power and precision of mapping efforts and greatly hampers analysis of epistatic interactions. RESULTS In order to address these limitations and to provide the community with a more effective collaborative RI mapping panel we generated new BXD RI strains from two independent advanced intercrosses (AI) between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) progenitor strains. Progeny were intercrossed for 9 to 14 generations before initiating inbreeding, which is still ongoing for some strains. Since this AI base population is highly recombinant, the 46 advanced recombinant inbred (ARI) strains incorporate approximately twice as many recombinations as standard RI strains, a fraction of which are inevitably shared by descent. When combined with the existing BXD RI strains, the merged BXD strain set triples the number of previously available unique recombinations and quadruples the total number of recombinations in the BXD background. CONCLUSION The combined BXD strain set is the largest mouse RI mapping panel. It is a powerful tool for collaborative analysis of quantitative traits and gene function that will be especially useful to study variation in transcriptome and proteome data sets under multiple environments. Additional strains also extend the value of the extensive phenotypic characterization of the previously available strains. A final advantage of expanding the BXD strain set is that both progenitors have been sequenced, and approximately 1.8 million SNPs have been characterized. This provides unprecedented power in screening candidate genes and can reduce the effective length of QTL intervals. It also makes it possible to reverse standard mapping strategies and to explore downstream effects of known sequence variants.},

abstract = {On the basis of eight independent quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies of ethanol (alcohol) preference drinking in mice, a meta-analysis was carried out to examine the replicability of QTLs across studies and to enhance the power of QTL detection and parameter estimation. To avoid genetic heterogeneity, we analyzed only studies of mapping populations derived from the C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) inbred progenitor strains. Because these studies were carried out in five different laboratories, there were substantial differences in testing procedure, data analysis, and especially in the choice of mapping population (BXD recombinant inbred strains, F2, backcross, selected lines, or congenic strains). Despite this, we found several QTLs that were sufficiently robust as to appear consistently across studies given the strengths and weaknesses of the mapping populations employed. These were on Chromosomes (Chrs) 2 (proximal to mid), 3 (mid to distal), 4 (distal), and 9 (proximal to mid). The P value for each of these QTLs, combined across all applicable studies, ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-15), with the additive effect of each QTL accounting for 3-5{\%} of the trait variance extrapolated to an F2 population. Two other QTLs on Chrs 1 (distal) and 11 (mid) were less consistent, but still reached overall significance (P {\textless}.0001).},

Here, we describe the inference of the underlying mosaic founder structure for the full set of RILs from a dense set of semicodominant restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) markers and use simulations to explore how variation in marker density and sequencing coverage affects inference. For a given sequencing effort, marker density is more important than sequence coverage per marker in terms of the amount of genetic information we can infer. We also assessed the power of the DSPR by assigning genotypes at a hidden QTL to each RIL on the basis of the inferred founder state and simulating phenotypes for different experimental designs, different genetic architectures, different sample sizes, and QTL of varying effect sizes. We found the DSPR has both high power (e.g., 84{\%} power to detect a 5{\%} QTL) and high mapping resolution (e.g., ∼1.5 cM for a 5{\%} QTL).},

Recent studies in hybrids and allopolyploids using transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, epigenomic and systems biology approaches have provided new insights. Emerging genomic and epigenetic perspectives suggest that heterosis arises from allelic interactions between parental genomes, leading to altered programming of genes that promote the growth, stress tolerance and fitness of hybrids. For example, epigenetic modifications of key regulatory genes in hybrids and allopolyploids can alter complex regulatory networks of physiology and metabolism, thus modulating biomass and leading to heterosis.

abstract = {UNLABELLED West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging neuroinvasive flavivirus that now causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The innate and adaptive immune responses to WNV infection have been well studied in C57BL/6J inbred mice, but this model lacks the variations in susceptibility, immunity, and outcome to WNV infection that are observed in humans, thus limiting its usefulness to understand the mechanisms of WNV infection and immunity dynamics. To build a model of WNV infection that captures human infection outcomes, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse model. We show that this model, which recapitulates the genetic diversity of the human population, demonstrates diversity in susceptibility and outcomes of WNV infection observed in humans. Using multiple F1 crosses of CC mice, we identified a wide range of susceptibilities to infection, as demonstrated through differences in survival, clinical disease score, viral titer, and innate and adaptive immune responses in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Additionally, we examined the Oas1b alleles in the CC mice and confirmed the previous finding that Oas1b plays a role in susceptibility to WNV; however, even within a given Oas1b allele status, we identified a wide range of strain-specific WNV-associated phenotypes. These results confirmed that the CC model is effective for identifying a repertoire of host genes involved in WNV resistance and susceptibility. The CC effectively models a wide range of WNV clinical, virologic, and immune phenotypes, thus overcoming the limitations of the traditional C57BL/6J model, allowing genetic and mechanistic studies of WNV infection and immunity in differently susceptible populations. IMPORTANCE Mouse models of West Nile virus infection have revealed important details regarding the innate and adaptive immune responses to this emerging viral infection. However, traditional mouse models lack the genetic diversity present in human populations and therefore limit our ability to study various disease outcomes and immunologic mechanisms subsequent to West Nile virus infection. In this study, we used the Collaborative Cross mouse model to more effectively model the wide range of clinical, virologic, and immune phenotypes present upon West Nile virus infection in humans.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with declining exercise and unhealthy changes in body composition. Exercise ameliorates certain adverse age-related physiological changes and protects against many chronic diseases. Despite these benefits, willingness to exercise and physiological responses to exercise vary widely, and long-term exercise and its benefits are difficult and costly to measure in humans. Furthermore, physiological effects of aging in humans are con- founded with changes in lifestyle and environment. We used C57BL/6J mice to examine long-term patterns of exercise during aging and its physiological effects in a well-controlled environment. One-year-old male (n = 30) and female (n = 30) mice were divided into equal size cohorts and aged for an additional year. One cohort was given access to voluntary running wheels while another was denied exercise other than home cage movement. Body mass, composition, and metabolic traits were measured before, throughout, and after 1 year of treatment. Long-term exercise significantly prevented gains in body mass and body fat, while preventing loss of lean mass. We observed sex-dependent differences in body mass and composition trajectories during aging. Wheel running (distance, speed, duration) was greater in females than males and declined with age. We conclude that long-term exercise may serve as a preventive measure against age-related weight gain and body composition changes, and that mouse inbred strains can be used to characterize effects of long-term exercise and factors (e.g. sex, age) modulating these effects. These findings will facilitate studies on relationships between exercise and health in aging populations, including genetic predisposition and genotype-by-environ- ment interactions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION High-density SNP data of model animal resources provides opportunities for fine-resolution genetic variation studies. These genetic resources are generated through a variety of breeding schemes that involve multiple generations of matings derived from a set of founder animals. In this article, we investigate the problem of inferring the most probable ancestry of resulting genotypes, given a set of founder genotypes. Due to computational difficulty, existing methods either handle only small pedigree data or disregard the pedigree structure. However, large pedigrees of model animal resources often contain repetitive substructures that can be utilized in accelerating computation. RESULTS We present an accurate and efficient method that can accept complex pedigrees with inbreeding in inferring genome ancestry. Inbreeding is a commonly used process in generating genetically diverse and reproducible animals. It is often carried out for many generations and can account for most of the computational complexity in real-world model animal pedigrees. Our method builds a hidden Markov model that derives the ancestry probabilities through inbreeding process without explicit modeling in every generation. The ancestry inference is accurate and fast, independent of the number of generations, for model animal resources such as the Collaborative Cross (CC). Experiments on both simulated and real CC data demonstrate that our method offers comparable accuracy to those methods that build an explicit model of the entire pedigree, but much better scalability with respect to the pedigree size.},

We demonstrate these advancements in mapping QTLs for hindlimb muscle weights in an AIL (n = 832) of the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) strains, generations F8-F13. We mapped muscle weight QTLs using the high-density MegaMUGA SNP panel. The QTLs highlight the shared genetic architecture of four hindlimb muscles and suggest that the genetic contributions to muscle variation are substantially different in males and females, at least in the B6D2 lineage. Out of the 15 muscle weight QTLs identified in the AIL, nine overlapped the genomic regions discovered in an earlier B6D2 F2 intercross. Mapping resolution, however, was substantially improved in our study to a median QTL interval of 12.5 Mb. Subsequent sequence analysis of the QTL regions revealed 20 genes with nonsense or potentially damaging missense mutations. Further refinement of the muscle weight QTLs using additional functional information, such as gene expression differences between alleles, will be important for discerning the causal genes.},

abstract = {The genome of the laboratory mouse is thought to be a mosaic of regions with distinct subspecific origins. We have developed a high-resolution map of the origin of the laboratory mouse by generating 25,400 phylogenetic trees at 100-kb intervals spanning the genome. On average, 92{\%} of the genome is of Mus musculus domesticus origin, and the distribution of diversity is markedly nonrandom among the chromosomes. There are large regions of extremely low diversity, which represent blind spots for studies of natural variation and complex traits, and hot spots of diversity. In contrast with the mosaic model, we found that most of the genome has intermediate levels of variation of intrasubspecific origin. Finally, mouse strains derived from the wild that are supposed to represent different mouse subspecies show substantial intersubspecific introgression, which has strong implications for evolutionary studies that assume these are pure representatives of a given subspecies.},

abstract = {The goal of the Collaborative Cross (CC) project was to generate and distribute over 1000 independent mouse recombinant inbred strains derived from eight inbred founders. With inbreeding nearly complete, we estimated the extinction rate among CC lines at a remarkable 95{\%}, which is substantially higher than in the derivation of other mouse recombinant inbred populations. Here, we report genome-wide allele frequencies in 347 extinct CC lines. Contrary to expectations, autosomes had equal allelic contributions from the eight founders, but chromosome X had significantly lower allelic contributions from the two inbred founders with underrepresented subspecific origins (PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). By comparing extinct CC lines to living CC strains, we conclude that a complex genetic architecture is driving extinction, and selection pressures are different on the autosomes and chromosome X Male infertility played a large role in extinction as 47{\%} of extinct lines had males that were infertile. Males from extinct lines had high variability in reproductive organ size, low sperm counts, low sperm motility, and a high rate of vacuolization of seminiferous tubules. We performed QTL mapping and identified nine genomic regions associated with male fertility and reproductive phenotypes. Many of the allelic effects in the QTL were driven by the two founders with underrepresented subspecific origins, including a QTL on chromosome X for infertility that was driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. We also performed the first example of cross validation using complementary CC resources to verify the effect of sperm curvilinear velocity from the PWK/PhJ haplotype on chromosome 2 in an independent population across multiple generations. While selection typically constrains the examination of reproductive traits toward the more fertile alleles, the CC extinct lines provided a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of fertility in a widely genetically variable population. We hypothesize that incompatibilities between alleles with different subspecific origins is a key driver of infertility. These results help clarify the factors that drove strain extinction in the CC, reveal the genetic regions associated with poor fertility in the CC, and serve as a resource to further study mammalian infertility.},

abstract = {Genetic influences on anxiety disorders are well documented; however, the specific genes underlying these disorders remain largely unknown. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for conditioned fear and open field behavior, we used an F2 intercross (n = 490) and a 34th-generation advanced intercross line (AIL) (n = 687) from the LG/J and SM/J inbred mouse strains. The F2 provided strong support for several QTL, but within wide chromosomal regions. The AIL yielded much narrower QTL, but the results were less statistically significant, despite the larger number of mice. Simultaneous analysis of the F2 and AIL provided strong support for QTL and within much narrower regions. We used a linear mixed-model approach, implemented in the program QTLRel, to correct for possible confounding due to familial relatedness. Because we recorded the full pedigree, we were able to empirically compare two ways of accounting for relatedness: using the pedigree to estimate kinship coefficients and using genetic marker estimates of "realized relatedness." QTL mapping using the marker-based estimates yielded more support for QTL, but only when we excluded the chromosome being scanned from the marker-based relatedness estimates. We used a forward model selection procedure to assess evidence for multiple QTL on the same chromosome. Overall, we identified 12 significant loci for behaviors in the open field and 12 significant loci for conditioned fear behaviors. Our approach implements multiple advances to integrated analysis of F2 and AILs that provide both power and precision, while maintaining the advantages of using only two inbred strains to map QTL.},

By measuring genome-wide transcript and protein expression in livers from 192 Diversity outbred mice, we identify 2,866 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) with twice as many local as distant genetic variants. These data support distinct transcriptional and post-transcriptional models underlying the observed pQTL effects. Using a sensitive approach to mediation analysis, we often identified a second protein or transcript as the causal mediator of distant pQTL. Our analysis reveals an extensive network of direct protein-protein interactions. Finally, we show that local genotype can provide accurate predictions of protein abundance in an independent cohort of collaborative cross mice.},

In this process, nitrogen represents a limiting nutrient and its scarcity results in important economic losses for the wine industry. Yeast isolates use different strategies to grow in poor nitrogen environments and their genomic plasticity enables adaptation to multiple habitats through improvements in nitrogen consumption. Here, we used a highly recombinant S. cerevisiae multi-parent population (SGRP-4X) derived from the intercross of four parental strains of different origins to identify new genetic variants responsible for nitrogen consumption differences during wine fermentation. Analysis of 165 fully sequenced F12 segregants allowed us to map 26 QTL in narrow intervals for 14 amino acid sources and ammonium, the majority of which represent genomic regions previously unmapped for these traits. To complement this strategy, we performed Bulk segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) analysis in segregants exhibiting extremely high and low ammonium consumption levels. This identified several QTL overlapping differentially expressed genes and refined the gene candidate search. Based on these approaches, we were able to validate ARO1, PDC1, CPS1, ASI2, LYP1, and ALP1 allelic variants underlying nitrogen consumption differences between strains, providing evidence of many genes with small phenotypic effects. Altogether, these variants significantly shape yeast nitrogen consumption with important implications for evolution, ecological, and quantitative genomics.},

abstract = {Population structure and kinship are widespread confounding factors in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It has been standard practice to include principal components of the genotypes in a regression model in order to account for population structure. More recently, the linear mixed model (LMM) has emerged as a powerful method for simultaneously accounting for population structure and kinship. The statistical theory underlying the differences in empirical performance between modeling principal components as fixed versus random effects has not been thoroughly examined. We undertake an analysis to formalize the relationship between these widely used methods and elucidate the statistical properties of each. Moreover, we introduce a new statistic, effective degrees of freedom, that serves as a metric of model complexity and a novel low rank linear mixed model (LRLMM) to learn the dimensionality of the correction for population structure and kinship, and we assess its performance through simulations. A comparison of the results of LRLMM and a standard LMM analysis applied to GWAS data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) illustrates how our theoretical results translate into empirical properties of the mixed model. Finally, the analysis demonstrates the ability of the LRLMM to substantially boost the strength of an association for HDL cholesterol in Europeans.},

abstract = {Genetic dissection of complex, polygenic trait variation is a key goal of medical and evolutionary genetics. Attempts to identify genetic variants underlying complex traits have been plagued by low mapping resolution in traditional linkage studies, and an inability to identify variants that cumulatively explain the bulk of standing genetic variation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Thus, much of the heritability remains unexplained for most complex traits. Here we describe a novel, freely available resource for the Drosophila community consisting of two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs), each derived from an advanced generation cross between a different set of eight highly inbred, completely resequenced founders. The Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) has been designed to combine the high mapping resolution offered by multiple generations of recombination, with the high statistical power afforded by a linkage-based design. Here, we detail the properties of the mapping panel of {\textgreater}1600 genotyped RILs, and provide an empirical demonstration of the utility of the approach by genetically dissecting alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme activity. We confirm that a large fraction of the variation in this classic quantitative trait is due to allelic variation at the Adh locus, and additionally identify several previously unknown modest-effect trans-acting QTL (quantitative trait loci). Using a unique property of multiparental linkage mapping designs, for each QTL we highlight a relatively small set of candidate causative variants for follow-up work. The DSPR represents an important step toward the ultimate goal of a complete understanding of the genetics of complex traits in the Drosophila model system.},

Using regression modeling of inferred haplotypes based on a hidden Markov model reconstruction and mixed model analysis in which we accounted for the complex family structure of the HS, we identified one sharp peak within this region. Using positional bootstrapping, we determined the most likely location of this locus is from 205.04 to 207.48 Mb.

abstract = {The mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has emerged as an important tool for linking genetic variation to changes in gene regulation. However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10{\%}). We call such variants 'DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16{\%}) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55{\%} of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Recent studies have identified thousands of regions in the genome associated with chromatin modifications, which may in turn be affecting gene expression. Existing works have used heuristic methods to investigate the relationships between genome, epigenome, and gene expression, but, to our knowledge, none have explicitly modeled the chain of causality whereby genetic variants impact chromatin, which impacts gene expression. In this work we introduce a new hierarchical fine-mapping framework that integrates information across all three levels of data to better identify the causal variant and chromatin mark that are concordantly influencing gene expression. In simulations we show that our method is more accurate than existing approaches at identifying the causal mark influencing expression. We analyze empirical genetic, chromatin, and gene expression data from 65 African-ancestry and 47 European-ancestry individuals and show that many of the paths prioritized by our method are consistent with the proposed causal model and often lie in likely functional regions.},

ABSTRACT The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparent panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains derived from eight founder laboratory strains. RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease of relative insulin deficiency resulting from both insulin resistance and beta cell failure. We have previously used heterogeneous stock (HS) rats to fine-map a locus for glucose tolerance. We show here that glucose intolerance in the founder strains of the HS colony is mediated by different mechanisms: insulin resistance in WKY and an insulin secretion defect in ACI, and we demonstrate a high degree of variability for measures of insulin resistance and insulin secretion in HS rats. As such, our goal was to use HS rats to fine-map several diabetes-related traits within a region on rat chromosome 1. We measured blood glucose and plasma insulin levels after a glucose tolerance test in 782 male HS rats. Using 97 SSLP markers, we genotyped a 68 Mb region on rat chromosome 1 previously implicated in glucose and insulin regulation. We used linkage disequilibrium mapping by mixed model regression with inferred descent to identify a region from 198.85 to 205.9 that contains one or more quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fasting insulin and a measure of insulin resistance, the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. This region also encompasses loci identified for fasting glucose and Insulin{\_}AUC (area under the curve). A separate {\textless}3 Mb QTL was identified for body weight. Using a novel penalized regression method we then estimated effects of alternative haplotype pairings under each locus. These studies highlight the utility of HS rats for fine-mapping genetic loci involved in the underlying causes of T2D.},

Here we show that mice from the Collaborative Cross panel of recombinant inbred mice exhibit distinct disease phenotypes after mouse-adapted Ebola virus infection. Phenotypes range from complete resistance to lethal disease to severe hemorrhagic fever characterized by prolonged coagulation times and 100{\%} mortality. Inflammatory signaling was associated with vascular permeability and endothelial activation, and resistance to lethal infection arose by induction of lymphocyte differentiation and cellular adhesion, probably mediated by the susceptibility allele Tek.

abstract = {We describe a new approach, called recombinant inbred intercross (RIX) mapping, that extends the power of recombinant inbred (RI) lines to provide sensitive detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for complex genetic and nongenetic interactions. RIXs are generated by producing F1 hybrids between all or a subset of parental RI lines. By dramatically extending the number of unique, reproducible genomes, RIXs share some of the best properties of both the parental RI and F2 mapping panels. These attributes make the RIX method ideally suited for experiments requiring analysis of multiple parameters, under different environmental conditions and/or temporal sampling. However, since any pair of RIX genomes shares either one or no parental RIs, this cross introduces an unusual population structure requiring special computational approaches for analysis. Herein, we propose an efficient statistical procedure for QTL mapping with RIXs and describe a novel empirical permutation procedure to assess genome-wide significance. This procedure will also be applicable to diallel crosses. Extensive simulations using strain distribution patterns from CXB, AXB/BXA, and BXD mouse RI lines show the theoretical power of the RIX approach and the analysis of CXB RIXs demonstrates the limitations of this procedure when using small RI panels.},

We mapped a single causative locus and identified a nonsynonymous mutation of serine to phenylalanine (S968F) in Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as the causative variant. The S968F mutation destabilizes CYFIP2, and deletion of the C57BL/6N mutant allele leads to acute and sensitized cocaine-response phenotypes.

However, until recently, we have known little about the mechanisms by which most regulatory variants act. For instance, what types of functional elements in DNA, RNA, or proteins are most often affected by regulatory variants? Which stages of gene regulation are typically altered? How can we predict which variants are most likely to impact regulation in a given cell type? Recent studies, in many cases using quantitative trait loci (QTL)-mapping approaches in cell lines or tissue samples, have provided us with considerable insight into the properties of genetic loci that have regulatory roles. Such studies have uncovered novel biochemical regulatory interactions and led to the identification of previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms. We have learned that genetic variation is often directly associated with variation in regulatory activities (namely, we can map regulatory QTLs, not just expression QTLs [eQTLs]), and we have taken the first steps towards understanding the causal order of regulatory events (for example, the role of pioneer transcription factors). Yet, in most cases, we still do not know how to interpret overlapping combinations of regulatory interactions, and we are still far from being able to predict how variation in regulatory mechanisms is propagated through a chain of interactions to eventually result in changes in gene expression profiles.},

abstract = {The nutritional environments that organisms experience are inherently variable, requiring tight coordination of how resources are allocated to different functions relative to the total amount of resources available. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that key endocrine pathways play a fundamental role in this coordination. In particular, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways have been implicated in nutrition-dependent changes in metabolism and nutrient allocation. However, little is known about the genetic basis of standing variation in IIS/TOR or how diet-dependent changes in expression in this pathway influence phenotypes related to resource allocation. To characterize natural genetic variation in the IIS/TOR pathway, we used {\&}gt;250 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a multiparental mapping population, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, to map transcript-level QTL of genes encoding 52 core IIS/TOR components in three different nutritional environments [dietary restriction (DR), control (C), and high sugar (HS)]. Nearly all genes, 87{\%}, were significantly differentially expressed between diets, though not always in ways predicted by loss-of-function mutants. We identified cis (i.e., local) expression QTL (eQTL) for six genes, all of which are significant in multiple nutrient environments. Further, we identified trans (i.e., distant) eQTL for two genes, specific to a single nutrient environment. Our results are consistent with many small changes in the IIS/TOR pathways. A discriminant function analysis for the C and DR treatments identified a pattern of gene expression associated with the diet treatment. Mapping the composite discriminant function scores revealed a significant global eQTL within the DR diet. A correlation between the discriminant function scores and the median life span (r = 0.46) provides evidence that gene expression changes in response to diet are associated with longevity in these RILs.},

abstract = {Identifying natural allelic variation that underlies quantitative trait variation remains a fundamental problem in genetics. Most studies have employed either simple synthetic populations with restricted allelic variation or performed association mapping on a sample of naturally occurring haplotypes. Both of these approaches have some limitations, therefore alternative resources for the genetic dissection of complex traits continue to be sought. Here we describe one such alternative, the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC). This approach is expected to improve the precision with which QTL can be mapped, improving the outlook for QTL cloning. Here, we present the first panel of MAGIC lines developed: a set of 527 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) descended from a heterogeneous stock of 19 intermated accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These lines and the 19 founders were genotyped with 1,260 single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotyped for development-related traits. Analytical methods were developed to fine-map quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the MAGIC lines by reconstructing the genome of each line as a mosaic of the founders. We show by simulation that QTL explaining 10{\%} of the phenotypic variance will be detected in most situations with an average mapping error of about 300 kb, and that if the number of lines were doubled the mapping error would be under 200 kb. We also show how the power to detect a QTL and the mapping accuracy vary, depending on QTL location. We demonstrate the utility of this new mapping population by mapping several known QTL with high precision and by finding novel QTL for germination data and bolting time. Our results provide strong support for similar ongoing efforts to produce MAGIC lines in other organisms.},

abstract = {The present study measured variation in body weight using a combined analysis in an F(2) intercross and an F(34) advanced intercross line (AIL). Both crosses were derived from inbred LG/J and SM/J mice, which were selected for large and small body size prior to inbreeding. Body weight was measured at 62 (± 5) days of age. Using an integrated GWAS and forward model selection approach, we identified 11 significant QTLs that affected body weight on ten different chromosomes. With these results we developed a full model that explained over 18{\%} of the phenotypic variance. The median 1.5-LOD support interval was 5.55 Mb, which is a significant improvement over most prior body weight QTLs. We identified nonsynonymous coding SNPs between LG/J and SM/J mice in order to further narrow the list of candidate genes. Three of the genes with nonsynonymous coding SNPs (Rad23b, Stk33, and Anks1b) have been associated with adiposity, waist circumference, and body mass index in human GWAS, thus providing evidence that these genes may underlie our QTLs. Our results demonstrate that a relatively small number of loci contribute significantly to the phenotypic variance in body weight, which is in marked contrast to the situation in humans. This difference is likely to be the result of strong selective pressure and the simplified genetic architecture, both of which are important advantages of our system.},

@article{Bandillo2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article describes the development of Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross populations (MAGIC) in rice and discusses potential applications for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and for rice varietal development. We have developed 4 multi-parent populations: indica MAGIC (8 indica parents); MAGIC plus (8 indica parents with two additional rounds of 8-way F1 inter-crossing); japonica MAGIC (8 japonica parents); and Global MAGIC (16 parents - 8 indica and 8 japonica). The parents used in creating these populations are improved varieties with desirable traits for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, yield, and grain quality. The purpose is to fine map QTLs for multiple traits and to directly and indirectly use the highly recombined lines in breeding programs. These MAGIC populations provide a useful germplasm resource with diverse allelic combinations to be exploited by the rice community.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The indica MAGIC population is the most advanced of the MAGIC populations developed thus far and comprises 1328 lines produced by single seed descent (SSD). At the S4 stage of SSD a subset (200 lines) of this population was genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach and was phenotyped for multiple traits, including: blast and bacterial blight resistance, salinity and submergence tolerance, and grain quality. Genome-wide association mapping identified several known major genes and QTLs including Sub1 associated with submergence tolerance and Xa4 and xa5 associated with resistance to bacterial blight. Moreover, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) results also identified potentially novel loci associated with essential traits for rice improvement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The MAGIC populations serve a dual purpose: permanent mapping populations for precise QTL mapping and for direct and indirect use in variety development. Unlike a set of naturally diverse germplasm, this population is tailor-made for breeders with a combination of useful traits derived from multiple elite breeding lines. The MAGIC populations also present opportunities for studying the interactions of genome introgressions and chromosomal recombination.},

abstract = {For most complex traits we have a poor understanding of the positions, phenotypic effects, and population frequencies of the underlying genetic variants contributing to their variation. Recently, several groups have developed multi-parent advanced intercross mapping panels in different model organisms in an attempt to improve our ability to characterize causative genetic variants. These panels are powerful and are particularly well suited to the dissection of phenotypic variation generated by rare alleles and loci segregating multiple functional alleles. We describe studies using one such panel, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), and the implications for our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. In particular, we note that many loci of large effect appear to be multiallelic. If multiallelism is a general rule, analytical approaches designed to identify multiallelic variants should be a priority for both genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and multi-parental panels.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Kelada.Allergic asthma is common airway disease that is characterized in part by enhanced airway constriction in response to nonspecific stimuli. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with asthma risk in humans, but these studies have not accounted for gene-environment interactions, which are thought to be important factors in asthma. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate responses to a common human allergen, we applied a house dust mite mouse (HDM) model of allergic airway disease (AAD) to 146 incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) and the CC founder strains. We employed a longitudinal study design in which mice were phenotyped for response to the bronchoconstrictor methacholine both before and after HDM sensitization and challenge using whole body plethysmography (WBP). There was significant variation in methacholine responsiveness due to both strain and HDM treatment, as reflected by changes in the WBP parameter enhanced pause. We also found that distinct QTL regulate baseline [chromosome (Chr) 18] and post-HDM (Chr 19) methacholine responsiveness and that post-HDM airway responsiveness was correlated with other features of AAD. Finally, using invasive measurements of airway mechanics, we tested whether the Chr 19 QTL affects lung resistance perse using C57BL/6J mice and a consomic strain but found that QTL haplotype did not affect lung resistance. We conclude that aspects of baseline and allergen-induced methacholine responsiveness are associated with genetic variation, and that robust detection of airway resistance QTL in genetically diverse mice will be facilitated by direct measurement of airway mechanics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Raghavan et al. Multi-parent Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) populations are fast becoming mainstream tools for research and breeding, along with the technology and tools for analysis. This paper demonstrates the analysis of a rice MAGIC population from data filtering to imputation and processing of genetic data to characterizing genomic structure, and finally quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In this study, 1316 S6:8 indica MAGIC (MI) lines and the eight founders were sequenced using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS). As the GBS approach often includes missing data, the first step was to impute the missing SNPs. The observable number of recombinations in the population was then explored. Based on this case study, a general outline of procedures for a MAGIC analysis workflow is provided, as well as for QTL mapping of agronomic traits and biotic and abiotic stress, using the results from both association and interval mapping approaches. QTL for agronomic traits (yield, flowering time, and plant height), physical (grain length and grain width) and cooking properties (amylose content) of the rice grain, abiotic stress (submergence tolerance), and biotic stress (brown spot disease) were mapped. Through presenting this extensive analysis in the MI population in rice, we highlight important considerations when choosing analytical approaches. The methods and results reported in this paper will provide a guide to future genetic analysis methods applied to m ulti-parent populations.},

abstract = {Prolonged selective breeding of Hsd:ICR mice for high levels of voluntary wheel running has favored an unusual phenotype (mini-muscle [MM]), apparently caused by a single Mendelian recessive allele, in which hindlimb muscle mass is reduced by almost 50{\%}. We recently described the creation and phenotypic characterization of a population suitable for mapping the genomic location of the MM gene. Specifically, we crossed females from a high-runner line fixed for the MM allele with male C57BL/6J. F1 males were then backcrossed to the MM parent females. Backcross (BC) mice exhibited a 50:50 ratio of normal to MM phenotypes. Here, we report on linkage mapping of MM in this BC population to a 2.6335-Mb interval on MMU11. This region harbors approximately 100 expressed or predicted genes, many of which have known roles in muscle development and/or function. Identification of the genetic variation that underlies MM could potentially be very important in understanding both normal muscle function and disregulation of muscle physiology leading to disease.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Initial sensitivity to drugs of abuse often predicts subsequent use and abuse, but this relationship is not always observed in human studies. Moreover, studies examining the relationship between initial locomotor sensitivity and the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs in animal models have also been equivocal. Understanding the relationship between initial drug effects and propensity to continue use, potentially resulting in the development of a substance use disorder, may help to identify key targets for prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVES We examined intravenous cocaine self-administration in a set of mouse strains that were previously identified to be at the phenotypic extremes for cocaine-induced locomotor activation to determine if initial locomotor sensitivity predicted acquisition, extinction, dose response, or progressive ratio (PR) breakpoint. METHODS We selected eight inbred mouse strains based on locomotor sensitivity to 20 mg/kg cocaine. These strains, designated as low and high responders, were tested in an intravenous self-administration paradigm that included acquisition of 0.5 mg/(kg*inf) under a FR1 schedule, extinction, re-acquisition, dose response to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/(kg*inf), and progressive ratio. RESULTS We observed overall differences in self-administration behavior between high and low responders. Low responders self-administered less cocaine and had lower breakpoints under the PR schedule. However, we also observed strain differences within each group. Self-administration in the low responder, LG/J, more closely resembled the behavior of the high-responding group, and the high responder, P/J, had self-administration behavior that more closely resembled the low-responding group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that acute cocaine-induced locomotor activation does predict self-administration behavior, but in a strain-specific manner. These data support the idea that genetic background influences the relationship among addiction-related behaviors.},

Next, we exploited bioinformatic sequence and expression data to identify candidate genes based on the existence of non-synonymous coding polymorphisms and/or expression QTLs.
