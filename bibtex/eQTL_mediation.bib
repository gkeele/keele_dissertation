We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. The Simes method for testing intersection of more than two hypotheses is known to control the probability of type I error only when the underlying test statistics are independent. Although this method is more powerful than the classical Bonferroni method, it is not known whether it is conservative when the test statistics are dependent. This article proves that for multivariate distributions exhibiting a type of positive dependence that arise in many multiple-hypothesis testing situations, the Simes method indeed controls the probability of type I error. This extends some results established very recently in the special case of two hypotheses.},

abstract = {Understanding the consequences of regulatory variation in the human genome remains a major challenge, with important implications for understanding gene regulation and interpreting the many disease-risk variants that fall outside of protein-coding regions. Here, we provide a direct window into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by sequencing RNA from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory variation--by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first time we identify thousands of variants associated with specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression. Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal and trans (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further, generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the genomic properties of variants associated with expression and splicing and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies. Together, these results represent a critical step toward characterizing the complete landscape of human regulatory variation.},

abstract = {The JAX Diversity Outbred population is a new mouse resource derived from partially inbred Collaborative Cross strains and maintained by randomized outcrossing. As such, it segregates the same allelic variants as the Collaborative Cross but embeds these in a distinct population architecture in which each animal has a high degree of heterozygosity and carries a unique combination of alleles. Phenotypic diversity is striking and often divergent from phenotypes seen in the founder strains of the Collaborative Cross. Allele frequencies and recombination density in early generations of Diversity Outbred mice are consistent with expectations based on simulations of the mating design. We describe analytical methods for genetic mapping using this resource and demonstrate the power and high mapping resolution achieved with this population by mapping a serum cholesterol trait to a 2-Mb region on chromosome 3 containing only 11 genes. Analysis of the estimated allele effects in conjunction with complete genome sequence data of the founder strains reduced the pool of candidate polymorphisms to seven SNPs, five of which are located in an intergenic region upstream of the Foxo1 gene.},

abstract = {Mucus hyper-secretion is a hallmark feature of asthma and other muco-obstructive airway diseases. The mucin proteins MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major glycoprotein components of mucus and have critical roles in airway defense. Despite the biomedical importance of these two proteins, the loci that regulate them in the context of natural genetic variation have not been studied. To identify genes that underlie variation in airway mucin levels, we performed genetic analyses in founder strains and incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) in a house dust mite mouse model of asthma. CC founder strains exhibited significant differences in MUC5AC and MUC5B, providing evidence of heritability. Analysis of gene and protein expression of Muc5ac and Muc5b in incipient CC lines (n = 154) suggested that post-transcriptional events were important regulators of mucin protein content in the airways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified distinct, trans protein QTL for MUC5AC (chromosome 13) and MUC5B (chromosome 2). These two QTL explained 18 and 20{\%} of phenotypic variance, respectively. Examination of the MUC5B QTL allele effects and subsequent phylogenetic analysis allowed us to narrow the MUC5B QTL and identify Bpifb1 as a candidate gene. Bpifb1 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in parallel to MUC5B after allergen challenge, and Bpifb1 knockout mice exhibited higher MUC5B expression. Thus, BPIFB1 is a novel regulator of MUC5B.},

abstract = {In recent years, multiple eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) catalogs have become available that can help understand the functionality of complex trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In eQTL catalogs, gene expression is often strongly associated with multiple SNPs, which may reflect either one or multiple independent associations. Conditional eQTL analysis allows a distinction between dependent and independent eQTLs. We performed conditional eQTL analysis in 4,896 peripheral blood microarray gene expression samples. Our analysis showed that 35{\%} of genes with a cis eQTL have at least two independent cis eQTLs; for several genes up to 13 independent cis eQTLs were identified. Also, 12{\%} (671) of the independent cis eQTLs identified in conditional analyses were not significant in unconditional analyses. The number of GWAS catalog SNPs identified as eQTL in the conditional analyses increases with 24{\%} as compared to unconditional analyses. We provide an online conditional cis eQTL mapping catalog for whole blood (https://eqtl.onderzoek.io/), which can be used to lookup eQTLs more accurately than in standard unconditional whole blood eQTL databases.},

abstract = {Clinical trials of tolvaptan showed it to be a promising candidate for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) but also revealed potential for idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in this patient population. To identify risk factors and mechanisms underlying tolvaptan DILI, 8 mice in each of 45 strains of the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population were treated with a single oral dose of either tolvaptan or vehicle. Significant elevations in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed in tolvaptan-treated animals in 3 of the 45 strains. Genetic mapping coupled with transcriptomic analysis in the liver was used to identify several candidate susceptibility genes including epoxide hydrolase 2, interferon regulatory factor 3, and mitochondrial fission factor. Gene pathway analysis revealed that oxidative stress and immune response pathways were activated in response to tolvaptan treatment across all strains, but genes involved in regulation of bile acid homeostasis were most associated with tolvaptan-induced elevations in ALT. Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (Slpi) mRNA was also induced in the susceptible strains and was associated with increased plasma levels of Slpi protein, suggesting a potential serum marker for DILI susceptibility. In summary, tolvaptan induced signs of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and innate immune response in all strains, but variation in bile acid homeostasis was most associated with susceptibility to the liver response. This CC study has indicated potential mechanisms underlying tolvaptan DILI and biomarkers of susceptibility that may be useful in managing the risk of DILI in ADPKD patients.},

Here we use simulation to investigate the power of the collaborative cross to detect and map small genetic effects. We show that for a fixed population of 1000 individuals, 500 RI lines bred using a modified version of the collaborative cross design are adequate to map a single additive locus that accounts for 5{\%} of the phenotypic variation to within 0.96 cM. In the presence of strong epistasis more strains can improve detection, but 500 lines still provide sufficient resolution to meet most goals of the collaborative cross. However, even with a very large panel of RILs, mapping resolution may not be sufficient to identify single genes unambiguously. Our results are generally applicable to the design of RILs in other species.},

These include: (i) a method of identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping) for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods, explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait.},

abstract = {High-resolution mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in animals has proved to be difficult because the large effect sizes detected in crosses between inbred strains are often caused by numerous linked QTLs, each of small effect. In a study of fearfulness in mice, we have shown it is possible to fine map small-effect QTLs in a genetically heterogeneous stock (HS). This strategy is a powerful general method of fine mapping QTLs, provided QTLs detected in crosses between inbred strains that formed the HS can be reliably detected in the HS. We show here that single-marker association analysis identifies only two of five QTLs expected to be segregating in the HS and apparently limits the strategy's usefulness for fine mapping. We solve this problem with a multipoint analysis that assigns the probability that an allele descends from each progenitor in the HS. The analysis does not use pedigrees but instead requires information about the HS founder haplotypes. With this method we mapped all three previously undetected loci [chromosome (Chr.) 1 logP 4.9, Chr. 10 logP 6.0, Chr. 15 logP 4.0]. We show that the reason for the failure of single-marker association to detect QTLs is its inability to distinguish opposing phenotypic effects when they occur on the same marker allele. We have developed a robust method of fine mapping QTLs in genetically heterogeneous animals and suggest it is now cost effective to undertake genomewide high-resolution analysis of complex traits in parallel on the same set of mice.},

The model underlying RABBIT accounts for the joint pattern of recombination breakpoints between two homologous chromosomes, and missing data and allelic typing errors in the genotype data of both sampled individuals and founders. Studies on simulated data of the MAGIC and the CC and real data of the MAGIC, the DO, and the CC demonstrate that RABBIT is more robust and accurate in reconstructing recombination bin maps than some commonly used methods.},

ABSTRACT The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparent panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains derived from eight founder laboratory strains. RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.},

abstract = {Genetic variation modulates protein expression through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To characterize the consequences of natural genetic diversity on the proteome, here we combine a multiplexed, mass spectrometry-based method for protein quantification with an emerging outbred mouse model containing extensive genetic variation from eight inbred founder strains. By measuring genome-wide transcript and protein expression in livers from 192 Diversity outbred mice, we identify 2,866 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) with twice as many local as distant genetic variants. These data support distinct transcriptional and post-transcriptional models underlying the observed pQTL effects. Using a sensitive approach to mediation analysis, we often identified a second protein or transcript as the causal mediator of distant pQTL. Our analysis reveals an extensive network of direct protein-protein interactions. Finally, we show that local genotype can provide accurate predictions of protein abundance in an independent cohort of collaborative cross mice.},

abstract = {Highly recombinant populations derived from inbred lines, such as advanced intercross lines and heterogeneous stocks, can be used to map loci far more accurately than is possible with standard intercrosses. However, the varying degrees of relatedness that exist between individuals complicate analysis, potentially leading to many false positive signals. We describe a method to deal with these problems that does not require pedigree information and accounts for model uncertainty through model averaging. In our method, we select multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) models using forward selection applied to resampled data sets obtained by nonparametric bootstrapping and subsampling. We provide model-averaged statistics about the probability of loci or of multilocus regions being included in model selection, and this leads to more accurate identification of QTL than by single-locus mapping. The generality of our approach means it can potentially be applied to any population of unknown structure.},

Here we report a combined sequence and genetic mapping analysis in outbred rats that maps 355 quantitative trait loci for 122 phenotypes. We identify 35 causal genes involved in 31 phenotypes, implicating new genes in models of anxiety, heart disease and multiple sclerosis. The relationship between sequence and genetic variation is unexpectedly complex: at approximately 40{\%} of quantitative trait loci, a single sequence variant cannot account for the phenotypic effect. Using comparable sequence and mapping data from mice, we show that the extent and spatial pattern of variation in inbred rats differ substantially from those of inbred mice and that the genetic variants in orthologous genes rarely contribute to the same phenotype in both species.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Kelada.Allergic asthma is common airway disease that is characterized in part by enhanced airway constriction in response to nonspecific stimuli. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with asthma risk in humans, but these studies have not accounted for gene-environment interactions, which are thought to be important factors in asthma. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate responses to a common human allergen, we applied a house dust mite mouse (HDM) model of allergic airway disease (AAD) to 146 incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) and the CC founder strains. We employed a longitudinal study design in which mice were phenotyped for response to the bronchoconstrictor methacholine both before and after HDM sensitization and challenge using whole body plethysmography (WBP). There was significant variation in methacholine responsiveness due to both strain and HDM treatment, as reflected by changes in the WBP parameter enhanced pause. We also found that distinct QTL regulate baseline [chromosome (Chr) 18] and post-HDM (Chr 19) methacholine responsiveness and that post-HDM airway responsiveness was correlated with other features of AAD. Finally, using invasive measurements of airway mechanics, we tested whether the Chr 19 QTL affects lung resistance perse using C57BL/6J mice and a consomic strain but found that QTL haplotype did not affect lung resistance. We conclude that aspects of baseline and allergen-induced methacholine responsiveness are associated with genetic variation, and that robust detection of airway resistance QTL in genetically diverse mice will be facilitated by direct measurement of airway mechanics.},

abstract = {Abstract   The power to detect QTL using near-isogenic line (NIL) comparisons versus recombinant inbred (RI) populations was assessed. The power to detect QTL was found to be generally greater when using RI populations than when using NIL contrasts. Power to detect QTL with NIL contrasts never exceeded that of RI populations when the number of RI lines is maximized relative to replication of lines for a given number of experimental units. The relative power of NIL contrasts is highest for traits with high heritability and when a gain in precision is realized due to increased replication of entries. Although NIL populations are generally less powerful than RI populations of similar size, some practical considerations may enhance the value of these materials. Availability of NILs allows the genetic effect of a specific chromosome region to be determined by comparing two lines; all RI lines in a population need to be rescored for each new trait even if the effect of a specific chromosome region is suspected. NIL comparisons may allow genetic differences to be detected by visual inspection; genetic effects can only be expressed as means and variances with recombinant inbred populations. In summary, RI populations generally, and in some cases, substantially, provide better power for QTL detection than NIL comparisons. Practical considerations, however, indicate that many factors need to be considered when choosing a population structure to meet an experimental objective.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION High-density SNP data of model animal resources provides opportunities for fine-resolution genetic variation studies. These genetic resources are generated through a variety of breeding schemes that involve multiple generations of matings derived from a set of founder animals. In this article, we investigate the problem of inferring the most probable ancestry of resulting genotypes, given a set of founder genotypes. Due to computational difficulty, existing methods either handle only small pedigree data or disregard the pedigree structure. However, large pedigrees of model animal resources often contain repetitive substructures that can be utilized in accelerating computation. RESULTS We present an accurate and efficient method that can accept complex pedigrees with inbreeding in inferring genome ancestry. Inbreeding is a commonly used process in generating genetically diverse and reproducible animals. It is often carried out for many generations and can account for most of the computational complexity in real-world model animal pedigrees. Our method builds a hidden Markov model that derives the ancestry probabilities through inbreeding process without explicit modeling in every generation. The ancestry inference is accurate and fast, independent of the number of generations, for model animal resources such as the Collaborative Cross (CC). Experiments on both simulated and real CC data demonstrate that our method offers comparable accuracy to those methods that build an explicit model of the entire pedigree, but much better scalability with respect to the pedigree size.},
