abstract = {Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting complex traits is often pursued in single-cross experiments. For most purposes, including breeding, some assessment is desired of the generalizability of the QTL findings and of the overall genetic architecture of the trait. Single-cross experiments provide a poor basis for these purposes, as comparison across experiments is hampered by segregation of different allelic combinations among different parents and by context-dependent effects of QTL. To overcome this problem, we combined the benefits of QTL analysis (to identify genomic regions affecting trait variation) and classic diallel analysis (to obtain insight into the general inheritance of the trait) by analyzing multiple mapping families that are connected via shared parents. We first provide a theoretical derivation of main (general combining ability (GCA)) and interaction (specific combining ability (SCA)) effects on F(2) family means relative to variance components in a randomly mating reference population. Then, using computer simulations to generate F(2) families derived from 10 inbred parents in different partial-diallel designs, we show that QTL can be detected and that the residual among-family variance can be analyzed. Standard diallel analysis methods are applied in order to reveal the presence and mode of action (in terms of GCA and SCA) of undetected polygenes. Given a fixed experiment size (total number of individuals), we demonstrate that QTL detection and estimation of the genetic architecture of polygenic effects are competing goals, which should be explicitly accounted for in the experimental design. Our approach provides a general strategy for exploring the genetic architecture, as well as the QTL underlying variation in quantitative traits.},

abstract = {1. Six strains under long term selection for egg production and other economically?important traits were crossed in a full diallel, and tested with two commercial stocks and two control strains at two stocking rates (1 bird per 20.3cm cage and 3 birds per 30.5cm cage) and two diets (with and without an oyster shell supplement). 2. The mean of the 30 strain crosses exceeded the mean of the six selected strains for egg production and egg quality traits, sexual maturity and viability, which in turn exceeded the performance of both of the control strains. The performance of several of the 30 strain crosses was similar to the commercial stocks. 3. The only significant genotype ? environment interaction was for Haugh units at 450 d. 4. Performance at the lower stocking rate was generally superior to that at the higher stocking rate. 5. General combining ability was important for the complete array of traits measured. 6. Specific combining ability was important for the majority of traits. 7. Heterosis was important for all traits except specific gravity, Haugh units, blood spots and laying house viability to 272 or 496 d at the higher stocking rate. 8. The magnitude of heterotic effects was generally greater at the higher stocking rate. 9. Reciprocal effects were important for egg production traits, sexual maturity, egg quality traits and viability. 10. The dietary oyster shell supplement resulted in an improvement in shell quality as measured by specific gravity.},

abstract = {The inbred mouse C57BL/6J is the reference strain for genome sequence and for most behavioral and physiological phenotypes. However, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium uses an embryonic stem cell line derived from a related C57BL/6N substrain. We found that C57BL/6N has a lower acute and sensitized response to cocaine and methamphetamine. We mapped a single causative locus and identified a nonsynonymous mutation of serine to phenylalanine (S968F) in Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as the causative variant. The S968F mutation destabilizes CYFIP2, and deletion of the C57BL/6N mutant allele leads to acute and sensitized cocaine-response phenotypes. We propose that CYFIP2 is a key regulator of cocaine response in mammals and present a framework to use mouse substrains to identify previously unknown genes and alleles regulating behavior.},

abstract = {Drug liking vs. drug disliking is a subjective motivational measure in humans that assesses the addiction liability of drugs. Variation in this trait is hypothesized to influence vulnerability vs. resilience toward substance abuse disorders and likely contains a genetic component. In rodents and humans, conditioned place preference (CPP)/aversion (CPA) is a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm whereby a learned preference for the drug-paired environment is used to infer drug liking whereas a learned avoidance or aversion is used to infer drug disliking. C57BL/6 inbred mouse substrains are nearly genetically identical, yet demonstrate robust differences in addiction-relevant behaviors, including locomotor sensitization to cocaine and consumption of ethanol. Here, we tested the hypothesis that B6 substrains would demonstrate differences in the rewarding properties of the mu opioid receptor agonist oxycodone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the aversive properties of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Both substrains showed similar degrees of oxycodone-induced CPP; however, there was a three-fold enhancement of naloxone-induced CPA in agonist-na{\"{i}}ve C57BL/6J relative to C57Bl/6NJ mice. Exploratory factor analysis of CPP and CPA identified unique factors that explain variance in behavioral expression of reward vs. aversion. "Conditioned Opioid-Like Behavior" was a reward-based factor whereby drug-free locomotor variables resembling opioid treatment co-varied with the degree of CPP. "Avoidance and Freezing" was an aversion-based factor, whereby the increase in the number of freezing bouts co-varied with the degree of aversion. These results provide new insight into the behavioral architecture of the motivational properties of opioids. Future studies will use quantitative trait locus mapping in B6 substrains to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to the marked strain difference in NAL-CPA.},

abstract = {C57BL/6 inbred mice have been widely used as research models; however, widespread demand has led to the creation of several B6 substrains with markedly different phenotypes. In this study, we report that two substrains of C57BL/6 mice, C57BL/6J (B6J) and C57BL/6NCrl (B6C), separated over 50 years ago at two different breeding facilities differ significantly in alcohol consumption and alcohol preference. The genomes of these two substrains are estimated to differ by only 1-2{\%} of all gene loci, providing a unique opportunity to extract particular expression signatures between these substrains that are associated with quantifiable behavioral differences. Expression profiling of the cortex and striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum and the ventral brain region from alcohol-na{\"{i}}ve B6C and B6J mice showed intervals on three chromosomes that are enriched in clusters of coregulated transcripts significantly divergent between the substrains. Additional analysis identified two genomic regions containing putative copy number differences between the substrains. One such region on chromosome 14 contained an estimated 3n copy number in the B6J genome compared with B6C. Within this interval, a gene of unknown function, D14Ertd449e, was found to be both associated with alcohol preference and vary in copy number across several inbred strain lineages. H2afz, Psen1, Wdfy1 and Clu were also identified as candidate genes that may be involved in influencing alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The mouse inbred line C57BL/6J is widely used in mouse genetics and its genome has been incorporated into many genetic reference populations. More recently large initiatives such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are using the C57BL/6N mouse strain to generate null alleles for all mouse genes. Hence both strains are now widely used in mouse genetics studies. Here we perform a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the two strains to identify differences that may influence their underlying genetic mechanisms. RESULTS We undertake genome sequence comparisons of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N to identify SNPs, indels and structural variants, with a focus on identifying all coding variants. We annotate 34 SNPs and 2 indels that distinguish C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N coding sequences, as well as 15 structural variants that overlap a gene. In parallel we assess the comparative phenotypes of the two inbred lines utilizing the EMPReSSslim phenotyping pipeline, a broad based assessment encompassing diverse biological systems. We perform additional secondary phenotyping assessments to explore other phenotype domains and to elaborate phenotype differences identified in the primary assessment. We uncover significant phenotypic differences between the two lines, replicated across multiple centers, in a number of physiological, biochemical and behavioral systems. CONCLUSIONS Comparison of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N demonstrates a range of phenotypic differences that have the potential to impact upon penetrance and expressivity of mutational effects in these strains. Moreover, the sequence variants we identify provide a set of candidate genes for the phenotypic differences observed between the two strains.},

abstract = {Ethanol craving plays a major role in relapse drinking behavior. Relapse and ethanol craving are an important focus for the treatment of alcoholism. The ethanol-deprivation effect (EDE) is a widely used animal model of alcohol craving. While the EDE is widely studied in rats, the molecular mechanisms underlying EDE are not clearly understood. The C57BL/6 inbred mouse strain is widely used for behavioral and molecular analyses of ethanol drinking but studies on the EDE have not been reported in this strain. In the present study, we characterized a simple behavioral protocol that rapidly and reliably induced EDE in C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, single-housed adult male C57BL/6NCrl and C57BL/6J mice were presented at the beginning of dark phase with two-bottle choice drinking containing either 10{\%} wt/vol ethanol or tap water for 18 h/day, as well as food ad libitum. Following ethanol drinking for 4 days or 14 days, mice were deprived of ethanol for a period of 4 days. To study EDE, mice were reinstated with two bottles containing either ethanol (10{\%} wt/vol) or water. Mice were exposed to single or multiple ethanol-deprivation cycles. Ethanol consumption (g/kg/18 h) and percent ethanol preference ({\%} preference/18 hrs) was recorded for individual mice. C57BL/6NCrl mice consumed moderate amounts (4.78+/-0.63 g/kg) of ethanol but showed robust EDE after ethanol-drinking episodes (4 days or 14 days) as evidenced by increased ethanol consumption and ethanol preference following reinstatement of ethanol. While repeated ethanol deprivation in C57BL/6NCrl mice transiently increased ethanol consumption and ethanol preference, the magnitude of these behaviors was reduced as compared to the first deprivation cycle. In contrast, the C57BL/6J substrain consumed substantially higher levels (9.65+/-0.90 g/kg) of ethanol but did not show a clear EDE after single or multiple ethanol-deprivation cycles. In conclusion, we established a simple and reliable behavioral model to study EDE in C57BL/6NCrl mice. A reliable behavioral model to study EDE in inbred C57BL/6NCrl mice could greatly facilitate further studies on molecular mechanisms of ethanol craving behavior.},

abstract = {The classic diallel takes a set of parents and produces offspring from all possible mating pairs. Phenotype values among the offspring can then be related back to their respective parentage. When the parents are diploid, sexed, and inbred, the diallel can characterize aggregate effects of genetic background on a phenotype, revealing effects of strain dosage, heterosis, parent of origin, epistasis, and sex-specific versions thereof. However, its analysis is traditionally intricate, unforgiving of unplanned missing information, and highly sensitive to imbalance, making the diallel unapproachable to many geneticists. Nonetheless, imbalanced and incomplete diallels arise frequently, albeit unintentionally, as by-products of larger-scale experiments that collect F(1) data, for example, pilot studies or multiparent breeding efforts such as the Collaborative Cross or the Arabidopsis MAGIC lines. We present a general Bayesian model for analyzing diallel data on dioecious diploid inbred strains that cleanly decomposes the observed patterns of variation into biologically intuitive components, simultaneously models and accommodates outliers, and provides shrinkage estimates of effects that automatically incorporate uncertainty due to imbalance, missing data, and small sample size. We further present a model selection procedure for weighing evidence for or against the inclusion of those components in a predictive model. We evaluate our method through simulation and apply it to incomplete diallel data on the founders and F(1)'s of the Collaborative Cross, robustly characterizing the genetic architecture of 48 phenotypes.},

abstract = {Haloperidol is an efficacious antipsychotic drug that has serious, unpredictable motor side effects that limit its utility and cause noncompliance in many patients. Using a drug-placebo diallel of the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross and their F1 hybrids, we characterized aggregate effects of genetics, sex, parent of origin, and their combinations on haloperidol response. Treating matched pairs of both sexes with drug or placebo, we measured changes in the following: open field activity, inclined screen rigidity, orofacial movements, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, plasma and brain drug level measurements, and body weight. To understand the genetic architecture of haloperidol response we introduce new statistical methodology linking heritable variation with causal effect of drug treatment. Our new estimators, "difference of models" and "multiple-impute matched pairs", are motivated by the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework and extend our existing Bayesian hierarchical model for the diallel (Lenarcic et al. 2012). Drug-induced rigidity after chronic treatment was affected by mainly additive genetics and parent-of-origin effects (accounting for 28{\%} and 14.8{\%} of the variance), with NZO/HILtJ and 129S1/SvlmJ contributions tending to increase this side effect. Locomotor activity after acute treatment, by contrast, was more affected by strain-specific inbreeding (12.8{\%}). In addition to drug response phenotypes, we examined diallel effects on behavior before treatment and found not only effects of additive genetics (10.2-53.2{\%}) but also strong effects of epistasis (10.64-25.2{\%}). In particular: prepulse inhibition showed additivity and epistasis in about equal proportions (26.1{\%} and 23.7{\%}); there was evidence of nonreciprocal epistasis in pretreatment activity and rigidity; and we estimated a range of effects on body weight that replicate those found in our previous work. Our results provide the first quantitative description of the genetic architecture of haloperidol response in mice and indicate that additive, dominance-like inbreeding and parent-of-origin effects contribute strongly to treatment effect heterogeneity for this drug.},

abstract = {Developmental stability and canalization describe the ability of developmental systems to minimize phenotypic variation in the face of stochastic micro-environmental effects, genetic variation and environmental influences. Canalization is the ability to minimize the effects of genetic or environmental effects, whereas developmental stability is the ability to minimize the effects of micro-environmental effects within individuals. Despite much attention, the mechanisms that underlie these two components of phenotypic robustness remain unknown. We investigated the genetic structure of phenotypic robustness in the collaborative cross (CC) mouse reference population. We analysed the magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and among-individual variation of cranial shape in reciprocal crosses among the eight parental strains, using geometric morphometrics and a diallel analysis based on a Bayesian approach. Significant differences among genotypes were found for both measures, although they were poorly correlated at the level of individuals. An overall positive effect of inbreeding was found for both components of variation. The strain CAST/EiJ exerted a positive additive effect on FA and, to a lesser extent, among-individual variance. Sex- and other strain-specific effects were not significant. Neither FA nor among-individual variation was associated with phenotypic extremeness. Our results support the existence of genetic variation for both developmental stability and canalization. This finding is important because robustness is a key feature of developmental systems. Our finding that robustness is not related to phenotypic extremeness is consistent with theoretical work that suggests that its relationship to stabilizing selection is not straightforward.},

Some crosses recorded significant desired heterotic percentages relative to mid parents and better parent for all studied traits except for number of branches per plant. Both general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining abilities were significant for all studied traits revealing the important role of both additive and dominant components in the inheritance of the studied characters. The ratio of general and specific combining ability (GCA/SCA) indicated great additive effects for the majority of the studied characters. Giza 3 was proved to be a good combiner for all studied traits except for plant height and number of branches per plant. Several crosses exhibited significantly positive SCA effects for studied traits especially L.512 × NA112 and L.153 × Giza 3 which exhibited highest significant and positive SCA effects for seed yield per plant with high 100-seed weight and number of seeds per plant. Heritability in the broad sense (hb2 {\%}) estimates was generally high for all studied traits. However, heritability in the narrow sense was high for number of pods per plant (76.42), 100-seed weight (75.53), plant height (70.53) and number of branches per plant (62.00), while it was low for seed yield per plant. High heritability values coupled with high genetic advance observed for 100-seed weight and number of pods per plant indicated that such traits would respond to selection. These two traits might contribute to the increasing seed yield since they are important yield components.},

abstract = {Biologists studying adaptation under sexual selection have spent considerable effort assessing the relative importance of two groups of models, which hinge on the idea that females gain indirect benefits via mate discrimination. These are the good genes and genetic compatibility models. Quantitative genetic studies have advanced our understanding of these models by enabling assessment of whether the genetic architectures underlying focal phenotypes are congruent with either model. In this context, good genes models require underlying additive genetic variance, while compatibility models require non-additive variance. Currently, we know very little about how the expression of genotypes comprised of distinct parental haplotypes, or how levels and types of genetic variance underlying key phenotypes, change across environments. Such knowledge is important, however, because genotype-environment interactions can have major implications on the potential for evolutionary responses to selection.},

abstract = {A recombinant inbred intercross (RIX) is created by generating diallel F1 progeny from one or more panels of recombinant inbred (RI) strains. This design was originally introduced to extend the power of small RI panels for the confirmation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) provisionally detected in a parental RI set. For example, the set of 13 C x B (C57BL/6ByJ x BALB/cByJ) RI strains can, in principle, be supplemented with 156 isogenic F1s. We describe and test a method of analysis, based on a linear mixed model, that accounts for the correlation structure of RIX populations. This model suggests a novel permutation algorithm that is needed to obtain appropriate threshold values for genome-wide scans of an RIX population. Despite the combinational multiplication of unique genotypes that can be generated using an RIX design, the effective sample size of the RIX population is limited by the number of progenitor RI genomes that are combined. When using small RI panels such as the C x B there appears to be only modest advantage of the RIX design when compared with the original RI panel for detecting QTLs with additive effects. The RIX, however, does have an inherent ability to detect dominance effects, and, unlike RI strains, the RIX progeny are genetically reproducible but are not fully inbred, providing somewhat more natural genetic context. We suggest a breeding strategy, the balanced partial RIX, that balances the advantage of RI and RIX designs. This involves the use of a partial RIX population derived from a large RI panel in which the available information is maximized by minimizing correlations among RIX progeny.},

Two independent 5 x 5 diallel crosses were carried out, each one with a different male tester genotype. Interactions between male and female genotypes were detected because some lines appeared as dominant in one diallel and recessive in the other. The overall picture emerging from the analyses shows a genetic system for female receptivity characterized by additive genes, with dominance for high receptivity in one of the diallel crosses. This remarkable additive component does not support the action of natural selection favouring females with extreme values of receptivity, rather, the lack of intrasexual female competition for mates is suggested.},

These include: (i) a method of identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping) for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods, explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait.},

Several phenomena can cause parent-of-origin effects, but the best characterized is parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression associated with genomic imprinting. The development of new mapping approaches applied to the growing abundance of genomic data has demonstrated that imprinted genes can be important contributors to complex trait variation. Therefore, to understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases and traits of agricultural importance, it is crucial to account for these parent-of-origin effects. Here, we discuss patterns of phenotypic variation associated with imprinting, evidence supporting its role in complex trait variation and approaches for identifying its molecular signatures.},

abstract = {The Collaborative Cross Consortium reports here on the development of a unique genetic resource population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparental recombinant inbred panel derived from eight laboratory mouse inbred strains. Breeding of the CC lines was initiated at multiple international sites using mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Currently, this innovative project is breeding independent CC lines at the University of North Carolina (UNC), at Tel Aviv University (TAU), and at Geniad in Western Australia (GND). These institutions aim to make publicly available the completed CC lines and their genotypes and sequence information. We genotyped, and report here, results from 458 extant lines from UNC, TAU, and GND using a custom genotyping array with 7500 SNPs designed to be maximally informative in the CC and used a novel algorithm to infer inherited haplotypes directly from hybridization intensity patterns. We identified lines with breeding errors and cousin lines generated by splitting incipient lines into two or more cousin lines at early generations of inbreeding. We then characterized the genome architecture of 350 genetically independent CC lines. Results showed that founder haplotypes are inherited at the expected frequency, although we also consistently observed highly significant transmission ratio distortion at specific loci across all three populations. On chromosome 2, there is significant overrepresentation of WSB/EiJ alleles, and on chromosome X, there is a large deficit of CC lines with CAST/EiJ alleles. Linkage disequilibrium decays as expected and we saw no evidence of gametic disequilibrium in the CC population as a whole or in random subsets of the population. Gametic equilibrium in the CC population is in marked contrast to the gametic disequilibrium present in a large panel of classical inbred strains. Finally, we discuss access to the CC population and to the associated raw data describing the genetic structure of individual lines. Integration of rich phenotypic and genomic data over time and across a wide variety of fields will be vital to delivering on one of the key attributes of the CC, a common genetic reference platform for identifying causative variants and genetic networks determining traits in mammals.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) not only measures total gene expression but may also measure allele-specific gene expression in diploid individuals. RNA-seq data collected from F1 reciprocal crosses in mice can powerfully dissect strain and parent-of-origin effects on allelic imbalance of gene expression. In this article, we develop a novel statistical approach to analyze RNA-seq data from F1 and inbred strains. Method development was motivated by a study of F1 reciprocal crosses derived from highly divergent mouse strains, to which we apply the proposed method. Our method jointly models the total number of reads and the number of allele-specific reads of each gene, which significantly boosts power for detecting strain and particularly parent-of-origin effects. The method deals with the overdispersion problem commonly observed in read counts and can flexibly adjust for the effects of covariates such as sex and read depth. The X chromosome in mouse presents particular challenges. As in other mammals, X chromosome inactivation silences one of the two X chromosomes in each female cell, although the choice of which chromosome to be silenced can be highly skewed by alleles at the X-linked X-controlling element (Xce) and stochastic effects. Our model accounts for these chromosome-wide effects on an individual level, allowing proper analysis of chromosome X expression. Furthermore, we propose a genomic control procedure to properly control type I error for RNA-seq studies. A number of these methodological improvements can also be applied to RNA-seq data from other species as well as other types of next-generation sequencing data sets. Finally, we show through simulations that increasing the number of samples is more beneficial than increasing the library size for mapping both the strain and parent-of-origin effects. Unless sample recruiting is too expensive to conduct, we recommend sequencing more samples with lower coverage.},

Thus, allele-specific and total expression of hippocampal Igf2 is affected by maternal, grandmaternal CR in a strain and sex-specific manner.},

The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions at the Cacao Research Center (CEPEC), Ilh{\'{e}}us, Bahia, Brazil, in a completely randomized block design, in an experimental arrangement 21 x 2 [21 complete diallel crosses and two water regimes (control and stressed)]. In the control, soil moisture was kept close to field capacity, with predawn leaf water potential ($\Psi$WL) ranging from -0.1 to -0.5 MPa. In the drought regime, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by decreasing the amount of water application until $\Psi$WL reached -2.0 to -2.5 MPa. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed for most morphological attributes analyzed regarding progenies, water regime and their interactions. The results of the joint diallel analysis revealed significant effects between general combining ability (GCA) x water regimes and between specific combining ability (SCA) x water regimes. The SCA 6 genetic material showed high general combining ability for growth variables regardless of the water regime. In general, the water deficit influenced the production of biomass in most of the evaluated T. cacao crosses, except for SCA-6 x IMC-67, Catongo x SCA, MOC-01 x Catongo, Catongo x IMC-67 and RB-40 x Catongo. Multivariate analysis showed that stem diameter (CD), total leaf area (TLA), leaf dry biomass (LDB), stem dry biomass (SDB), root dry biomass (RDB), total dry biomass (TDB), root length (RL), root volume (RV), root diameter (RD) {\textless}1 mm and 1 {\textless}(RD) {\textless}2 mm were the most important growth parameters in the separation of T. cacao genotypes in to tolerant and intolerant to soil water deficit.},

When the goal is to make statements about populations represented by a given set of lines, it is desirable to maximize the number of lines sampled given a set number of crosses among them. We propose an augmented round-robin design that accomplishes this. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate quantitative genetic parameters from our scheme. For example, we show how to partition genetic effects into specific and general combining abilities, and the method provides estimates of heritability, dominance, and genetic correlations in the face of complex and unbalanced designs. We test our approach with simulated and real data. We show that although the models slightly overestimate genetic variances, main effects are assessed accurately and precisely. We also illustrate how our approach allows the construction of posterior distributions of combinations of parameters by calculating narrow-sense heritability and a genetic correlation between activities of two enzymes.},

We also compare three methods for constructing confidence regions for a QTL: likelihood regions, Bayesian credible sets, and support regions. We show that with an appropriate evaluation of the coverage probability a support region is approximately a confidence region, and we provide a theroretical explanation of the empirical observation that the size of the support region is proportional to the sample size, not the square root of the sample size, as one might expect from standard statistical theory.},

ABSTRACT The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparent panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains derived from eight founder laboratory strains. RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.},

@article{Sen2005,
abstract = {We examine the efficiency of different genotyping and phenotyping strategies in inbred line crosses from an information perspective. This provides a mathematical framework for the statistical aspects of QTL experimental design, while guiding our intuition. Our central result is a simple formula that quantifies the fraction of missing information of any genotyping strategy in a backcross. It includes the special case of selectively genotyping only the phenotypic extreme individuals. The formula is a function of the square of the phenotype and the uncertainty in our knowledge of the genotypes at a locus. This result is used to answer a variety of questions. First, we examine the cost-information trade-off varying the density of markers and the proportion of extreme phenotypic individuals genotyped. Then we evaluate the information content of selective phenotyping designs and the impact of measurement error in phenotyping. A simple formula quantifies the information content of any combined phenotyping and genotyping design. We extend our results to cover multigenotype crosses, such as the F(2) intercross, and multiple QTL models. We find that when the QTL effect is small, any contrast in a multigenotype cross benefits from selective genotyping in the same manner as in a backcross. The benefit remains in the presence of a second unlinked QTL with small effect (explaining {\textless}20{\%} of the variance), but diminishes if the second QTL has a large effect. Software for performing power calculations for backcross and F(2) intercross incorporating selective genotyping and marker spacing is available from http://www.biostat.ucsf.edu/sen.},

abstract = {Immune defence is hypothesized to be a trait that bears significant fitness costs as well as benefits in that mounting a defence depreciates the value of other life-history traits. Thus the cost of mounting an immune response could affect the evolution of both the immune system and correlated life history traits. In this study we examined, by means of a diallel cross of four inbred lines, the genetic basis of two measures of immune function, metabolic rate and several traits in the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. We specifically addressed the following questions: (1) is immune function determined primarily by genetic constitution or correlations with phenotypic traits that could reduce the effectiveness of the immune response; (2) do the two measures of immune function covary; (3) What are the contributions of additive, nonadditive and maternal effects to the immune function? As estimates of immune function, we used lytic activity and encapsulation rate. We found that inbred crickets were smaller than individuals from the crossed lines and took longer to develop. However, inbred lines did not differ from the crossed lines in immune function nor metabolic rates, suggesting that increased homozygosity has little or no effect on these traits in G. firmus. We found that both immune parameters showed significant genetic variation but no consistent relationships with the other phenotypic traits (metabolic rate, head width, body mass, development time and activity). There was significant additive genetic variation only in encapsulation rate, but, with the exception of the activity measure, significant nonadditive and reciprocal variances were found in all traits. Metabolic rate of crickets was heritable, but there was neither phenotypic nor genetic association between metabolic rate and the two parameters of immune function. Further, there was no correlation between these two measures. Females showed a higher encapsulation response than males, but there was no sex differences in lytic activity. Our study indicates that genetic variation in immune parameters can be a very significant contributor to phenotypic variation in immune function.},

abstract = {Reciprocal effects are due to genetic effects of the parents (i.e. maternal and paternal effects), cytoplasmic effects and parent-of-origin effects. However, in Zea mays L. the extent to which reciprocal effects exist, or can be attributed to specific underlying components, remains an area of interest and study. Reciprocal effects have been reported by several investigators for various agronomic characters in different types of maize materials for grain and silage usage. Maize geneticists and breeders have recognized reciprocal effects as one source of genetic variability, but the lack of consistency in the observation of these effects, particularly due to stress conditions, has prevented a systematic exploitation of these effects in practical breeding programs. There is mounting molecular evidence for underlying mechanisms in maize, which could be responsible for both the existence, and the instability of reciprocal effects. In this study, we developed population of reciprocal backcrosses based on an initial set of recombinant inbred lines. This population was used for dissecting reciprocal effects into the underlying components (maternal, cytoplasmic and parent-of-origin) effects. We also developed statistical framework to identify and map contributions of specific nuclear chromosomal regions to reciprocal effects. We showed that differences in maternal parents, endosperm DNA and maternally transmitted factors collectively influence reciprocal effects early during the season, and that their influence diluted at later stages. We also found evidence that parent-of-origin effects in the sporophyte DNA existed at all stages and played an important role in establishing differences between reciprocal backcrosses at later developmental stages.},

abstract = {The experiments were carried out in two research stations (MARDI Bukit Tangga, Kedah, and MARDI Seberang Perai, Penang) in Malaysia. The crossings were performed using the four inbred lines in complete diallel cross including selfs and reciprocals. We evaluated the yield components and fruit characters such as fruit yield per plant, vine length, days to fruit maturity, fruit weight, total soluble solid content, and rind thickness over a period of two planting seasons. General combining ability and its interaction with locations were statistically significant for all characteristics except number of fruits per plant across the environments. Results indicated that the additive genetic effects were important to the inheritance of these traits and the expression of additive genes was influenced greatly by environments. In addition, specific combining ability effect was statistically evident for fruit yield per plant, vine length, days to first female flower, and fruit weight. Most of the characters are simultaneously controlled by additive and nonadditive gene effects. This study demonstrated that the highest potential and promising among the crosses was cross P2 (BL-14) × P3 (6372-4), which possessed prolific plants, with early maturity, medium fruit weight and high soluble solid contents. Therefore this hybrid might be utilized for developing high yielding watermelon cultivars and may be recommended for commercial cultivation.},

abstract = {Genetic variation contributes to host responses and outcomes following infection by influenza A virus or other viral infections. Yet narrow windows of disease symptoms and confounding environmental factors have made it difficult to identify polymorphic genes that contribute to differential disease outcomes in human populations. Therefore, to control for these confounding environmental variables in a system that models the levels of genetic diversity found in outbred populations such as humans, we used incipient lines of the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred (RI) panel (the pre-CC population) to study how genetic variation impacts influenza associated disease across a genetically diverse population. A wide range of variation in influenza disease related phenotypes including virus replication, virus-induced inflammation, and weight loss was observed. Many of the disease associated phenotypes were correlated, with viral replication and virus-induced inflammation being predictors of virus-induced weight loss. Despite these correlations, pre-CC mice with unique and novel disease phenotype combinations were observed. We also identified sets of transcripts (modules) that were correlated with aspects of disease. In order to identify how host genetic polymorphisms contribute to the observed variation in disease, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. We identified several QTL contributing to specific aspects of the host response including virus-induced weight loss, titer, pulmonary edema, neutrophil recruitment to the airways, and transcriptional expression. Existing whole-genome sequence data was applied to identify high priority candidate genes within QTL regions. A key host response QTL was located at the site of the known anti-influenza Mx1 gene. We sequenced the coding regions of Mx1 in the eight CC founder strains, and identified a novel Mx1 allele that showed reduced ability to inhibit viral replication, while maintaining protection from weight loss.},

abstract = {Genetic benefits can enhance the fitness of polyandrous females through the high intrinsic genetic quality of females' mates or through the interaction between female and male genes. I used a full diallel cross, a quantitative genetics design that involves all possible crosses among a set of genetically homogeneous lines, to determine the mechanism through which polyandrous female decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) obtain genetic benefits. I measured several traits related to fitness and partitioned the phenotypic variance into components representing the contribution of additive genetic variance ('good genes'), nonadditive genetic variance (genetic compatibility), as well as maternal and paternal effects. The results reveal a significant variance attributable to both nonadditive and additive sources in the measured traits, and their influence depended on which trait was considered. The lack of congruence in sources of phenotypic variance among these fitness-related traits suggests that the evolution and maintenance of polyandry are unlikely to have resulted from one selective influence, but rather are the result of the collective effects of a number of factors.},

abstract = {The estimation of quantitative genetic parameters in wild populations is generally limited by the accuracy and completeness of the available pedigree information. Using relatedness at genomewide markers can potentially remove this limitation and lead to less biased and more precise estimates. We estimated heritability, maternal genetic effects and genetic correlations for body size traits in an unmanaged long-term study population of Soay sheep on St Kilda using three increasingly complete and accurate estimates of relatedness: (i) Pedigree 1, using observation-derived maternal links and microsatellite-derived paternal links; (ii) Pedigree 2, using SNP-derived assignment of both maternity and paternity; and (iii) whole-genome relatedness at 37 037 autosomal SNPs. In initial analyses, heritability estimates were strikingly similar for all three methods, while standard errors were systematically lower in analyses based on Pedigree 2 and genomic relatedness. Genetic correlations were generally strong, differed little between the three estimates of relatedness and the standard errors declined only very slightly with improved relatedness information. When partitioning maternal effects into separate genetic and environmental components, maternal genetic effects found in juvenile traits increased substantially across the three relatedness estimates. Heritability declined compared to parallel models where only a maternal environment effect was fitted, suggesting that maternal genetic effects are confounded with direct genetic effects and that more accurate estimates of relatedness were better able to separate maternal genetic effects from direct genetic effects. We found that the heritability captured by SNP markers asymptoted at about half the SNPs available, suggesting that denser marker panels are not necessarily required for precise and unbiased heritability estimates. Finally, we present guidelines for the use of genomic relatedness in future quantitative genetics studies in natural populations.},

@article{Zou2014,
abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) not only measures total gene expression but may also measure allele-specific gene expression in diploid individuals. RNA-seq data collected from F1 reciprocal crosses in mice can powerfully dissect strain and parent-of-origin effects on allelic imbalance of gene expression. In this article, we develop a novel statistical approach to analyze RNA-seq data from F1 and inbred strains. Method development was motivated by a study of F1 reciprocal crosses derived from highly divergent mouse strains, to which we apply the proposed method. Our method jointly models the total number of reads and the number of allele-specific reads of each gene, which significantly boosts power for detecting strain and particularly parent-of-origin effects. The method deals with the overdispersion problem commonly observed in read counts and can flexibly adjust for the effects of covariates such as sex and read depth. The X chromosome in mouse presents particular challenges. As in other mammals, X chromosome inactivation silences one of the two X chromosomes in each female cell, although the choice of which chromosome to be silenced can be highly skewed by alleles at the X-linked X-controlling element (Xce) and stochastic effects. Our model accounts for these chromosome-wide effects on an individual level, allowing proper analysis of chromosome X expression. Furthermore, we propose a genomic control procedure to properly control type I error for RNA-seq studies. A number of these methodological improvements can also be applied to RNA-seq data from other species as well as other types of next-generation sequencing data sets. Finally, we show through simulations that increasing the number of samples is more beneficial than increasing the library size for mapping both the strain and parent-of-origin effects. Unless sample recruiting is too expensive to conduct, we recommend sequencing more samples with lower coverage.},

Unbiasedness and efficiency of estimation were compared for MINQUE(1), restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and MINQUE theta which has parameter values for the prior values. MINQUE(1) is almost as efficient as MINQUE theta for unbiased estimation of genetic variance and covariance components. The bio-model is efficient and robust for estimating variance and covariance components for maternal and paternal effects as well as for nuclear effects. A procedure of adjusted unbiased prediction (AUP) is proposed for predicting random genetic effects in the bio-model. The jack-knife procedure is suggested for estimation of sampling variances of estimated variance and covariance components and of predicted genetic effects. Worked examples are given for estimation of variance and covariance components and for prediction of genetic merits.},
